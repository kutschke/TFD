A repo to test the behaviour of TFileDirectory::mkdir with the
changes introduced in art v3.10

setup mu2e
git clone https://github.com/kutschke/TFD
mkdir muse
cp TFD/u018 muse
muse setup -1 -q u018
muse build -j 8
art -c TFD/fcl/tfd1.fcl

Then examine the file tfd1.root.
It should have two subdirectories, m1 and m2, one for each module instantiation.
Each of this will have two histograms h1 and foo/h2 .
